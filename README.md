## Ideas and inspirations

 I started this project by looking for inspirations since i had no idea of what i wanted to do or how to start with this project. I then got an idea to 
 do something with the moon and skies. I started searching for examples of the nice illustrations of the skies. 
 
 These are what i found: 
 
- Moon and stars

 ## Process
 
 Experimenting 
 
 I started with experimenting with gradient in codepen. In order to make the different fases of the moon i had to use gradients to make this possible.
 Lucky for me in the second week i followed a workshop on gradients and was able to learn a few things about how gradients work. 
 
 I made a few notes about it which you can find [here](https://github.com/Whtneyas/css-to-the-rescue-2223/wiki/Gradients)
 
 
 I began experimenting what i learned during the workshop on my project. It took a lot of trials to get the gradients right. I had to cobine the radial and linear gradients to get what i wanted.

 ### Checkboxes 
 
 I am actually grateful for following the worshop on filter. I wanted to make  be able to filter the fases of the moon uses checkboxes. With 
 what i learned during the workshop i apply filter to my project using checkboxes and the has selector
 
 ### :has()
 
 **What does the has selector do?**
 
 The "has" selector in CSS is used to select elements that have a specific descendant element or set of descendant elements. It allows you to style elements   based on the presence of other elements within them. Iknow i could do so much with the has selector but there wasn;t much time on my side so in decided to    keep it simple 
 
 **How have i benefitted from the :has()**
 
 - With the has selector i could filter my moon fases by using forms
 - With the has selector i could show the name of the fase of the moon when the checbox is been clicked.

 **Changing from checkboxes to radio buttons.**
 
 
For my application i wanted to zoom in the moon when the checkboxes are being clicked. I forgot how checkboxes are. Checkboxes are used for selection more that one element while radio buttons are used for selecting one element out of two or more elements. I used checkboxes as a way of selecting the moon. So i needed to change it to make my application logical. 

### This is with checkboxes

### And this is the code  the html code i used.

 ### Challenges 
 
 
-  Making of the stars 

 I really had difficulties in making  the stars. I tried so many methods. I started by using the figure tag in html to make the stars but i realised ure with the figure tag i couldn't style it without having a text in the figure element. I spent so much time trying to figure out why it wasn't working .

 - Changed the figure tag to list items 
 
 I changes the figure element to list items and realised it started working perfectly as i wanted it to. I made a list of items in the ul and styled it individually using the nth-of-type selector. But i realised it was so difficult to style each item because i had over 100 stars i neeed to style. 
 
 
 - Progress Interview 
 
 After the progress interview with my lecturer Vasilis . He advised me to attend a workshop he is going to give called "Random". I guess you might be wondering what random is. But in this project Vasilis showed us how you can randomly style elements which i needed for making my stars. The work shop was a week ahead so i focused on making the fases of the moon.

 Failures.
 Position of stars
 
 I wanted the stars to be randomly be positioned and then have this blinking effect but that couldn't work out. So i found a new method. I decided to amke the stars move from up and down and give the stars a differen animation delay so that it will look randomly. 
 
 
 
Make the moon fases circulate. 

I want the fases of the moon to circulate perfectly  but it didn't work out. I tried but
